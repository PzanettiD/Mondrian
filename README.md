# Project-Mondrian
## Inspiration
This project was in honor of the works of Piet Mondrian, a dutch painter who pioneered in the field of abstract art.
## The application
The application will render 4 quadrants, with random generated colors and ellipses. After the click of the user, new colors are randomly generated. Here is how it works (in p5.js):

## processing / p5.js
This "web-app" was made firstly with processing, but then translated and uprgraded with p5.js. Both of these softwares/tools are really explored in the context of visual arts, and I thought I might give it a shot by trying to do something approaching one of my favourite artists.
