# Project-Mondrian
## Inspiration
This project was in honor of the works of [Piet Mondrian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piet_Mondrian), a dutch painter who pioneered in the field of abstract art. In this "web-app" I was aiming at mimicking his art, though with some amount of randomization.

## The application
There are currently two version, the first being in Processing (Java), and the second in Java Script (with p5.js). There will be rendered 4 quadrants into which there will be random generated colors and ellipses. After a click, new colors are randomly generated. Here is how it works in *p5.js*, with some bolder color choices than the original (on the right):

## processing / p5.js
This "web-app" was made firstly with [Processing](https://processing.org/), but then translated and uprgraded with [p5.js](https://p5js.org/). Both of these softwares/tools are really explored in the context of visual arts, and I thought I might give it a shot by trying to do something approaching one of my favourite artists.
